                <h2>FIRE BREAKOUT AT KR MANGALAM</h2>
                <p>
                    A fire broke out at the college—but worry not,
                    as the only thing hotter than the flames was 
                    the drama that unfolded when students realize
                    d it wasn't a drill.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    On the quad, Rescue Team AGNIVEER arrived, rappelling
                    from the building with the grace of a startled 
                    squirrel, as staff stared in disbelief. Campus legend <br>
                    says he'd been waiting for a real emergency so he 
                    could use his camouflage jumpsuit and ropes for 
                    “educational purposes.” Meanwhile, one confused freshman <br>

                    thought the evacuation was a flash mob and started dancing
                    outside—others quickly joined, making it the most 
                    coordinated response the student body had ever shown.

                <h2>EMPLOYEES PROTEST TO 'REDUCE WORKLOAD'</h2>
                <p>Employees at Widget & Co. staged a protest to reduce their
                 workload, armed with handmade signs reading, “My coffee <br>
                 is working overtime, why am I?” and “Will trade spreadsheets 
                 for sleep!” The crowd collectively declared a “meeting strike”: <br>
                 no attending meetings until someone invents a calendar app with
                 a nap feature. Rumor has it even the office printer joined in, <br>
                 refusing to work until given a two-hour lunch break. In the end,
                 management agreed—at least temporarily—to keep Friday afternoons <br>
                 meeting-free, as long as employees promised to stop chanting 
                 “Less stress, more rest!” near the copy machine</p>
